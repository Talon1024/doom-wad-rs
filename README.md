doom-wad-rs
===========

Talon1024's Rust crate for working with [Doom WAD](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/WAD) files.

This was originally part of the [doomaker](https://github.com/Talon1024/doomaker) project, but was moved to a separate repo so that it can be used more easily by other projects.

AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot, were NOT used in the process of writing this code.
